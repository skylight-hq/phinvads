**python-hessian** is a Python implemention of Hessian, a binary web services
protocol. It supports the `Hessian 1.0.2 specification
<http://hessian.caucho.com/doc/hessian-1.0-spec.xtp>`_ and the
`Hessian 2.0 Serialization Protocol
<http://hessian.caucho.com/doc/hessian-serialization.html>`_. The library
is a fork of `mustaine <https://github.com/bgilmore/mustaine>`_, which is no
longer maintained. It provides a standard HTTP-based client
as well as a general-purpose serialization library.
